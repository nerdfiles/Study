  <h1>are you new?</h1>
  <p>since the web wasn't much to call home about before "web3" came along, we
  should kick a few tires. expect analyses and screenshots. why should "critique" only arrive
  because we can count financial statements? web design is supposed to be a public
  good, or are you new to the 21<sup>st</sup>? your social infocology is not just
  stock tickers, and this apocalyptic cinematic universe ain't (just) a toy. there 
  are objective things, like accessibility ramps, you should expect out of an actually
  evolving web, not more pundits who can claim to be the expertise without any tools to bear.</p>
